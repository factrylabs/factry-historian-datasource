[Grafana](https://grafana.com) datasource for [Factry Historian](https://factry.io).

## Introduction

Empower anyone to analyze industrial process and event data with Grafana. The Grafana Data Source for Factry Historian makes it easy for users to browse assets, trend time-series and event data such as batches or shifts â€“ with zero technical skills required.

## Typical use cases

- Browsing your asset structure (e.g. ISA88/ISA95 equipment model)
- Trending time-series data, while auto-configuring units of measurement
- Overlaying of events (e.g. golden batch analysis)
- Ad-hoc overlaying of time-series data on top of events

## Features

- Query historical data using the asset tree defined in Factry Historian
- Query historical data using measurements from Factry Historian
- Autoload Units of Measurement, Y-axis scaling and HI/LO boundaries
- Query Events from Factry Historian (e.g. batches, CIP cycles)
- Annotate trends with Event data from Factry Historian
- Use assets, measurements and events from Factry Historian as variables to build dynamic dashboards

## Development

A data source backend plugin consists of both frontend and backend components, frontend components reside in `/src` and backend components reside in `/pkg`.

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.22.1 or later](https://golang.org/dl/)
  - [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [Node.js 20 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with [pnpm 8](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

After starting the application in either debug or normal mode, navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the plugin in Grafana. The datasource, along with some dashboards, will be automatically provisioned.

### Debug mode

To run the plugin in debug mode, with filewatchers and hot-reloading enabled:

```bash
make clean  # optional
make run_debug
```

### Normal mode

To run the plugin in normal mode, without filewatchers and hot-reloading:

```bash
make clean  # optional
make build_all
make run_server
```
