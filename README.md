A data source backend plugin consists of both frontend and backend components, frontend components reside in `/src` and backend components reside in `/pkg`.

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.22.1 or later](https://golang.org/dl/)

- [Node.js 20 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with [pnpm 8](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

After starting the application in either debug or normal mode, navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the plugin in Grafana. The datasource, along with some dashboards, will be automatically provisioned.

```bash
make clean  # optional
make run_debug
```

### Normal mode
